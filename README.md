# Volta
The Volta theatre group needs a website. This is an attempt to create one that isn't _too_ sucky.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/R13N/Volta
cd Volta
bundle install
```

## Developing
Run `bundle exec guard` and `bundle exec nanoc view` in two different sessions.
The first will compile your changes when you save them,
while the second serves you the site at http://localhost:3000.

## Deploying
You don't.
